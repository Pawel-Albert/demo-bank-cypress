# Login Page Test using Cypress and POM concept

This project is created for learning purposes and demonstrates the implementation of Page Object Model (POM) design pattern in Cypress.

The test site used for this project is "https://demo-bank.vercel.app/" and the creators of this site are the great guys from https://jaktestowac.pl/.

This project is also set to be a direct comparison to a similar project written (soon) in Playwright.

Please note that this is not a perfect implementation of POM, but still demonstrates the basic concept of POM in a simple manner.
