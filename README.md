# Login and dashboard Page Test using Cypress and POM concept

This project is created for learning purposes and demonstrates the implementation of Page Object Model (POM) design pattern in Cypress.

The test site used for this project is "https://demo-bank.vercel.app/" and the creators of this site are the great guys from https://jaktestowac.pl/.

Project is also set to be a direct comparison to a similar project written (soon) in Playwright.

Additionally, it's important to emphasize that the purpose of this project is to provide a clear comparison between Cypress and Playwright, with a focus on the ease of implementation and readability of the code. The use of POM in this project is only one of the many approaches to structuring tests, and some developers might consider using assertions directly in the test files as a better practice. However, the implementation in this project is meant to highlight the benefits of using POM in terms of code organization and maintainability, and not necessarily to promote it as the only or best approach.
